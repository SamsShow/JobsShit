# 🔒 Security & Safety Guide

## Is This Bot Safe to Use?

**YES!** This bot is completely safe and complies with Telegram's Terms of Service. Here's why:

### ✅ What Makes It Safe:

1. **Official API**: Uses Telegram's official API (not a hack or exploit)
2. **Read-Only**: Only reads messages from channels (no spam or automation)
3. **User Account**: Acts as your personal account, not a separate bot
4. **No Third Parties**: All data stays on your machine
5. **Passive Monitoring**: Just watches channels you're already a member of

### 🚫 You Won't Get Banned Because:

- **Not sending bulk messages** (no spam)
- **Not scraping data** (only reading what you already can see)
- **Not using automation for interactions** (just passive monitoring)
- **Respecting rate limits** (built-in protections)
- **Following Telegram ToS** (legitimate API usage)

## 🛡️ Built-in Safety Features

### 1. **Rate Limit Protection**
```python
# The bot automatically handles Telegram's rate limits
- Waits when Telegram asks it to wait
- Adds small delays between actions
- Retries failed operations safely
```

### 2. **Flood Protection**
- The bot catches `FloodWaitError` and waits the required time
- Never tries to bypass rate limits
- Respects Telegram's server requests

### 3. **Connection Safety**
- Automatic reconnection on network issues
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Safe session management

## ⚠️ Best Practices to Stay Safe

### DO:
✅ Monitor only channels you're legitimately interested in  
✅ Use reasonable keywords (not too broad)  
✅ Keep the bot running on one device at a time  
✅ Use your personal API credentials (don't share)  
✅ Monitor 1-3 channels at most  
✅ Keep your `.env` file secure  

### DON'T:
❌ Share your API credentials with anyone  
❌ Monitor 50+ channels simultaneously  
❌ Modify the bot to send automated messages  
❌ Use it for spam or harassment  
❌ Run multiple instances with the same credentials  
❌ Try to bypass rate limits  

## 🔐 Telegram's Rate Limits

Telegram has built-in protections to prevent abuse:

| Action | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Reading messages | ~20-30 per second |
| Sending messages | ~1 per second to same chat |
| API calls | Varies by method |

**Our bot respects ALL these limits automatically.**

## 📊 What Data is Collected?

### Stored Locally:
- Job postings that match your keywords
- Message IDs and timestamps
- Your keywords and preferences

### NOT Stored:
- Your phone number or personal info
- Messages that don't match your keywords
- Other users' data
- Any sensitive information

### Where:
- Everything is in `jobs_tracker.db` (SQLite file)
- Session data in `job_tracker_session.session`
- All files are LOCAL only

## 🚨 Red Flags to Avoid

You could risk your account if you:

1. **Send spam messages** (our bot doesn't do this)
2. **Scrape user data** (we only read job posts)
3. **Automate user interactions** (we don't interact)
4. **Bypass rate limits** (we respect them)
5. **Use unofficial/modified APIs** (we use official Telethon)

**None of these apply to our bot!**

## 🔑 API Security

### Your API Credentials:

Your `API_ID` and `API_HASH` are like a password:
- Keep them in `.env` (never commit to Git)
- Don't share them with anyone
- Each person should get their own from https://my.telegram.org

### Session Files:

The `.session` file stores your login:
- Keep it secure (it's in `.gitignore`)
- Delete it if you want to log out
- Don't share it (contains authentication tokens)

## 📱 Account Safety Tips

### 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Enable 2FA on your Telegram account:
- Settings → Privacy and Security → Two-Step Verification
- Adds extra protection to your account

### 2. Active Sessions
Check your active sessions regularly:
- Settings → Privacy and Security → Active Sessions
- You'll see "job_tracker_session" when the bot is running
- Terminate any suspicious sessions

### 3. Separate Account (Optional)
For extra safety, you can:
- Create a second Telegram account for the bot
- Use a Google Voice number or similar
- Keep your main account completely separate

## 🔍 Monitoring Your Usage

### Check if You're Rate Limited:
The bot will show messages like:
```
⚠️  Rate limit hit. Waiting 30 seconds...
```
This is NORMAL and SAFE. The bot handles it automatically.

### Signs of Healthy Operation:
```
✅ Bot started successfully!
👀 Monitoring channel: @jobchannel
✅ Notified about new job (matched: python)
```

### Warning Signs:
```
❌ Error: Authentication failed
❌ Error: Account banned
```
If you see "banned," contact Telegram support (very unlikely with this bot).

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### "FloodWaitError" Message:
- **Normal!** Just means you hit a rate limit
- Bot will wait automatically
- Not a ban, just temporary slowdown

### Can't Connect:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API credentials in `.env`
- Delete `.session` file and re-authenticate

### Account Issues:
- Contact Telegram Support: @SpamBot
- They'll tell you if there are any issues
- Explain you're using official API for personal use
